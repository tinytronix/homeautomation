Software for modules
- Controller -> python and php
- LoRaGateway -> Arduino
- LoRaBridge -> Arduino 
- LoRaINwallshutter -> Arduino

The Switchingmodules and the Analog module contain no software because they are passive I2C slaves.
The related code for switching actors and reading sensors can be found in the controller module php scripts.
