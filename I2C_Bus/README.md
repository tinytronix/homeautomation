Each DIN rail module consists of two circuit boards:
1. the dedicated function circuit board (Relais output, analog input etc...)
2. the I2C Bus Interface board.

The I2C Bus Interface board is designed to connect the I2C from each DIN Rail module
to its neigbour modules. 

The I2C Bus Interface module can be used for Typ 2C, Typ 4C and Typ 6C
DIN rail housings by cutting as required.
