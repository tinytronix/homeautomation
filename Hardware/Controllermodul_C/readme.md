# Purpose
This is the homeautomation "brain". The Controller is based upon a ESP8266 (ESP07). Arbitrary modules can be connected via I2C.
The Controller runs the software that contains the home automation logic which switches Relais, reads sensors and so on.

### Features
- ESP07
- 1 Relais
- 1-wire
- I2C Interface
- 1 PWM output
- connector for two status LEDs

### Comparison to Controllermodul_B
This module can be used instead of the raspberry controller. It can be connected to any of the sensor actor modules just like the Raspberry Controller.
The ESP07 Wifi Module can also be used as a I2C slave.
